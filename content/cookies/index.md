> The recipe is in the metric system and by mass, because the *other* system is ridiculous. Especially so for measuring fine particles like flour where compact and loose material has a significant difference in volume. On top of all of that the Imperial system killed an innocent Mars Climate Orbiter.

I have simple goals in life. One of the most important is to bake The World's Best Chocolate Chip Cookie (the capitalisation is a necessity: it's How You Know I'm Serious).

Unfortunately the path to greatness is not an easy one, it has been narrow and winding across sheer cliffs, the remains of those who have tried and failed littered along it. It has been a path of poor quality ovens, of confusion between baking soda and powder, molasses and Zucker√ºbensirup. A path that the end of which has rewarded me not only with the taste of victory, but the taste of the greatest chocolate chip cookies the human race has ever seen.
